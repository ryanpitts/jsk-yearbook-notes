		<p>Hello, future JSK fellows! From the class of 2025, we are so excited for you to embark on the best year of your lives.</p>
		<p>Our class gift to you is this photo board, a place to store memories, celebrate wins and catalog the beauty of this year. We invite you to use it however you‚Äôd like! But we took our original inspiration from the great artist and scribe, Benito Antonio Mart√≠nez Ocasio, aka Bad Bunny, who famously said, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9T_MGfzq7I&list=RDv9T_MGfzq7I&start_radio=1">DeB√ç TiRAR M√°S FOToS</a>.‚Äù Just make sure to leave some supplies behind for the next class, so they can get off to a running start!</p>

		<p>Key info:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We originally stocked the supply box with a Fujifilm Instax mini photo printer (you can upload any digital image directly from the phone app) and Instax film.</li>
			<li>We‚Äôre gonna replace that JSK 2025 sign with something more permanent/pretty, just wait a few weeks please. üòÄ</li>
			<li>Whenever the technology needs to be replaced or the information on this site needs to be updated, please reach out to <a href="mailto:ryan.a.pitts@gmail.com">Ryan Pitts</a>.</li>
		</ul>

			<p>We‚Äôre raising a glass to you, to serendipity, and to the magic of JSK!</p>
			<p>Class of 2025</p>
